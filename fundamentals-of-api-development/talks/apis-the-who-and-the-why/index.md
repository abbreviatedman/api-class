# What Is An API?

---
## Let's Ask You

How would you define what an API is?

There's no wrong answer here, just inexact ones on the way to a more precise definition!

## Our Answers

## These are good answers!

(I mean, _probably_. I wrote this slide days ago...)

The important things to note here are:

<!-- incremental-list -->
1. We've got some rough ideas.
2. I'll be asking you a _lot_ of questions like this during the course!
3. You _don't_ have to be an expert on APIs to give answering questions a try.
4. But we _will_ answer _every_ in-scope question we ask.

## A More Precise Definition

An API is:

<!-- incremental-list -->

- A **user** **interface** to an **app**. ðŸ™‹â†”ðŸ–¥
- By which the user and app exchange **data**. ðŸ™‹â†”ðŸ“ˆâ†”ðŸ–¥
- And the **user** is a separate **app**. ðŸ–¥â†”ðŸ“ˆâ†”ðŸ–¥

## An API "Exposes" Its Data

The API is a program, _usually_ on an HTTP server, that gives other apps access to its valuable data.

Users  of the API (or "consumers") can:

- Access the data.
- Change, update, or delete data (with permission!)

## Example APIs

Let's take a break and try accessing some!

Use your nearest or dearest tool (the browser, Postman, the terminal, Insomnia, VS Code, Emacs) to try these links:

- [Coindesk's BitCoin Price Index](https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json)
- [The Weather In Miami](http://wttr.in/Miami?format=j1)
- [A partial list of ships in Star Wars](https://www.swapi.tech/api/starships)

Result you should see: a bunch of JSON data.

Note: here are the links for easy sharing from speaker view - Coindesk: https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json - The Weather In Miami: http://wttr.in/Miami?format=j1 - A partial list of ships in Star Wars: https://www.swapi.tech/api/starships
