# The Magicians Local API Exercise
print("hello everybody!")
# Your task: create a command-line app to serve as an API to the data in `characters.json` and `quotes.json` (partial data from the TV show The Magicians).

# Please read the following specifications and note the helper functions given
# to you already.  Your job should boil down to the logic required to follow
# the specifications, with a minimum of Python-specific gotchas.

# Don't worry about error handling, input validation, or any of those
# (genuinely vital) tasks. This will never be a production app!
#
# (If it is, blame your instructor for the technical debt accrued.)


# NOTE: handling POST requests is a bonus specification. Handle GET first!

# Specifications
#
# This program will print to the console the resource or resources requested by
# the user, according to the command-line arguments the user gives.
#
# The user will request data in the following command-line format:
# python main.py action data [index]
#
# `action` can be one of the following strings:
# "GET" || "POST"
#
# `data` can be one of the following strings:
# "characters" || "quotes"
#
# `index` is an OPTIONAL argument for GET requests. Its presence indicates that
# the user wants a single element from the list, the element at the index
# `index`.
#
# NOTE: like all command-line arguments, this will come in as a string as well.
# You MAY need to convert it to an integer.
#
# EXAMPLE:
# If the user enters `python main.py GET quotes 1`, the following quote should be printed to the console:
# {'episode': 'Unauthorized Magic', 'explicit': False, 'id': 1, 'lines': [{'speaker': 'Quentin', 'line': 'And, honestly, they probably take anyone conscious for philosophy.'}, {'speaker': 'Julia', 'line': 'For philosophy, "conscious" is a detriment.'}]}

# BONUS Specifications:
#
# 1. Instead of looking up a single resource (quote or character) by index,
# print the resource with the matching `id` property.
#
# 2a. Implement logic for handling a POST request. This will have a different
# command-line format:
# python main.py POST quotes new_quote
#
# `new_quote` will be a python dictionary, wrapped in double quotes, as in the
# following example:
# python main.py POST quotes "{'episode': 'Fundamentals of API Development', 'explicit': false, 'lines': [{'speaker': 'Colin', 'line': 'Example quote!'}]}"
#
# A POST request should have two results: the new quote should be printed to the
# console, and the JSON file for the request (quotes.json or characters.json)
# should be modified.
#
# 2b. Add an `id` field to the new resource. Make sure it does not already
# belong to an existing resource.

# BUILT IN CODE. Don't touch the below!

# Import required libraries.
import sys
import json


# The arguments from the command line.
arguments = sys.argv[1::]

# `arguments` should now be a list of command-line arguments.   If the user
# enters `python main.py the command line is cool.` on the command line,
# `arguments` will be a list of four items, like so:
#
# ["the", command", "line", "is", "cool."]
